  "lagonave_projects_title1": "Hope School",
  "lagonave_projects_description1": "On the island of La Gonave, sending children to school with an income of less than $2 a day is very difficult. Poor educational environment and lack of resources limit children's learning, threatening Haiti's future. Therefore, we are building new primary, middle, and high schools to provide safe and quality education. Centered on Christian education, this school shares Jesus' love and hope with the youth and guides them to understand and carry out the Lord's mission. Through this school, we hope the island's children will become the hope of Jesus and further, the hope of the world.",
  "lagonave_projects_title2": "Hope Clinic",
  "lagonave_projects_description2": "Opened in 2017, the Hope Clinic provides basic and emergency medical care, preventive education, and training for village health workers on La Gonave, where medical infrastructure is very poor. With about 10 medical staff, the clinic offers the best medical services to residents, including vaccinations, youth health insurance, and state-of-the-art medical equipment, serving as a central role in medical ministry on the island.",
  "lagonave_projects_title3": "Manna Project (Ministry for the Disabled)",
  "lagonave_projects_description3": "The Manna Project serves many neglected and extremely impoverished individuals on the island of La Gonave, including the blind, physically disabled, beggars, and mentally ill. Without anyone to care for them, they are in a very vulnerable environment physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They are in desperate need of regular basic food supplies, medical services, and care. This ministry regularly visits them to help and serve them with the Lord's touch.",
  "lagonave_projects_title4": "Dorcas Ministry for Single Mothers",
  "lagonave_projects_description4": "In impoverished areas like La Gonave, young girls are often unprotected and at risk of sexual assault, or they marry early for food and become pregnant at a young age. Becoming an underage single mother leads to abandonment by family, social and economic isolation, and dropping out of school, forcing them to struggle through life. Without external support, they cannot receive education or proper medical services. The Dorcas Ministry provides spiritual, emotional, and material support to these underage single mothers, helping them protect themselves and their families and form a beautiful faith community.",

  "dominica_projects_title1": "In Santiago, Dominican Republic...",
  "dominica_projects_text1": "In recent years, Haiti's national system has nearly collapsed due to a lack of security and gang activities. As a result, Haitians currently live in extreme isolation, hunger, economic poverty, and under the threat of murder. Nearly a million people have migrated to the neighboring Dominican Republic to escape this situation, but many face discrimination and human rights violations due to illegal immigration. Over 70% of migrants do not have proper visas, leaving many unable to receive adequate healthcare and education. Due to identity and financial issues, they cannot receive proper treatment in hospitals, and their children cannot receive proper education. We aim to improve their quality of life by providing proper medical services and quality child education, building healthy communities, and giving hope for the future.",
  "dominica_projects_title2": "Clinic de Salud Integral (CSI)",
  "dominica_projects_text2": "The Oak Tree Ministry team supports the healthy lives of Haitian migrants living in the Dominican Republic alongside their work on La Gonave Island. Operating a small clinic in the outskirts of Santiago, Pontezuela, they conduct the following ministries:\n\n1. Mobile clinics for the healthy lives of marginalized Haitians\n2. Providing clinical practice opportunities to locally trained Haitian medical professionals\n3. Emergency medical support through SNS to supplement care gaps\n4. Basic medical education for residents to build an improved health environment\n5. Programs to expand educational opportunities for children"
